# nltest

Nothing to see here. This is a test program that I used to test some netlink commands and libnl features. Gave me an opportunity to dive through the net/wireless/ source in the Linux kernel.

## Building

You can build `nltest` with `make`, there's no clean command because it just generates a single executable in the project's root directory
